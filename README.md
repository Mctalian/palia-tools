## Why is this called Palia Tools?

There's current plans to add other tools once the planner is considered feature-complete, with everything on the Road Map being ticked off.
What these tools are will depend on the current situation of community-made tools by the time the Garden Planner is at version 1.0.

## Roadmap

Plans for the Planner are found here: [Roadmap Link](https://palia-garden-planner.vercel.app/roadmap)
